        7. Data Transfers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Inflow is based in the United States (US). Personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and
        stored at, any of our affiliates, partners or service providers which may be inside or outside the European
        Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK) or Switzerland, including in the US. Your personal information
        may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you
        initially provided the information. Inflow complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S.
        Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the Data Privacy Framework (the "DPFs") to sputum transfer personal
        information outside the EEA, the UK and Switzerland to the U.S. as further described in the DPFs Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inflow may also transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland based on approved Standard
        Contractual Clauses, or otherwise in accordance with applicable data protection laws. When we transfer or
        disclose your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this
        privacy policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inflow will not rely on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or the UK Extension to the Data Privacy
        Framework until each enters into force, but Inflow adheres to their required commitments in anticipation of
        their doing so.
