        The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic
        charges ("Subscription Service"). The "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first
        subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue
        for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the "Initial Subscription Period"),
        and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period
        (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a "Subscription Period") unless you cancel
        the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Inflow
        and its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation
        of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the
        "Subscription Fee", please see our pricing page at https://Inflow.chat/pricing. Your account will be charged

        its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated
        with your account or that you otherwise provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if
        you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing your account
        settings at: https://account.Inflow.chat/billing and clicking on the "Cancel Plan" option or by contacting us
        at: conact@Inflow.com. Your cancellation must be received before the renewal date in order to avoid charge for
        the next subscription period.

        account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the
        unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal
        Subscription Fee is due, then reserves the right to delete your account and any information or User Content
        (defined below) associated with your account without any liability to you.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">14. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.1 Generally</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Inflow in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in the Arbitration provisions, you and Inflow agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, and communications from us will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, the Service, or any communications to or from us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND INFLOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.2 Exceptions</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Despite the provisions of 14.1 (Generally) above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.3 Opt-Out</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by emailing us at contact@inflow.chat or sending a letter to Inflow, Inc, Attention: 244 Madison Avenue Suite 1666, New York, NY 10016, United States ., that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once Inflow receives your Opt-Out Notice, Section 14.1 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 15 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.4 Arbitrator</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Any arbitration between you and Inflow will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "AAA Rules") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Inflow. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.5 Notice of Arbitration; Process.</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). Inflow's address for Notice is: 244 Madison Avenue Suite 1666, New York, NY 10016, United States ..The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Inflow may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Inflow must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Inflow in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Inflow will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.6 Fees</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Inflow will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee in accordance with AAA rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your billing address or another mutually agreed location, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Inflow for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on sols.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.7 No Class Actions</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        YOU AND INFLOW AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Inflow agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        If Inflow makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Inflow's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Inflow's address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Inflow will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">14.9 Enforceability</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        If Section 14.7 (No Class Actions) above or the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, or if Inflow receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        You agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. You and Inflow are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding. You can opt out of the binding arbitration within 30 days of agreeing to these Terms by sending a letter to us or by emailing us at legal@Inflow.com.
